Subject: KPMG Virtual Internship Job Simulation - Data Quality Issues and Mitigation Strategies
Hello,
I trust this email finds you well.
Following the voicemail sent to our analytics team, we have carefully reviewed the datasets you provided. Here are the key takeaways:
•	The datasets consist of three tables:
Customer Address: 12 columns
Transactions Data: 12 columns
Customer Demographic: 11 columns
•	There is a relationship among the three tables, with all tables containing a Customer ID column.
•	Inconsistencies appear to exist, likely resulting from data entry issues.
•	Some columns contain rows with missing values.
Moving forward, the analytics team will address the data cleaning process before proceeding to the analysis phase.
Best regards,
 Ivy Mwai
